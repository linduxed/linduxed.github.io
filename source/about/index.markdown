My name is **linduxed**. I code and talk a lot.

Apart from here on this site, you can find me on
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/linduxed), on [Github](http://github.com/linduxed)
and you might also bump into me on Reddit. I also organize and attend some
[programming meetups](http://www.meetup.com/members/86329492/).

If you're interested in my CV it can be found
[here](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/linduxed).

If we're not acquainted, e-mail is the best way to get a hold of me. Encrypt
and get address using GPG Key-ID `42A563BE`.
