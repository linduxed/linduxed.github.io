Recently my co-worker recommended me an anime series called "Attack on Titan".
The clips on Youtube looked good; the style was pretty cool, it looked like an
interesting setting and it looked like the focus was on people trying to
survive in a tough world.

Having seen all of the currently released episodes, I can say that all of the
above is true! The style, the setting, the story; all of that is there and is
enjoyable.

The big issue with the series is that all of above mentioned qualities are
wrapped in the shitty package of being an anime.

Spoilers ahead.

## So much shit I had forgotten

I've gone through a decent share of anime and it strikes me that the longer
you're away from it the harder it is to get back into it. It's like you build
up a kind of immunity to all the bullshit that is endemic to the genre.

### The two dimensional characters

I'm fine with characters who speak once every third episode or so to only be
defined by some role. "He always puts on a facade of cockiness", "She's
reckless but talented" or "His loss of family drives his will to improve".

However, when your main characters get no more depth than this, beyond
providing a reason for why they are defined by this "role" of theirs, then
eventually the show becomes frustratingly predictable.

You have the main guy called Eren, his adopted sister called Mikasa and their
friend called Armin. Let's start with Armin. The character has four defining
features:

1. Being weaker than both of his two friends and therefore frequently getting
   help from them throughout his life.
2. Being smart, getting told that he is, but never internalizing it.
3. Subsequently feeling inadequate close to his friends, feeling that he's weak
   and of little worth.
4. Looking and sounding so female that had they not used male pronouns to
   describe him you'd never have guessed. Yes, this more of a pet peeve of
   mine, but I'm still confused by the androgyny that is sprinkled in from time
   to time into anime.

That's the entire character. Any scene he participates in (and that's a lot
considering he only gets beat by Eren and *maybe* Mikasa when it comes to
screen time) you can be damn sure that he'll be feeling inadequate, Erin and
Mikasa will come reassuring him that he's the brains of the pack and he'll have
a moment of silence being surprised about this fact, where after the same shit
will happen in the next scene.  
No effort is made to make the character evolve into anything more than above
points. No flashes of breaking out of the role, no instances of the character
having other talents, just a repetition of the same traits over and over.
Eventually you realize that this all serves the purpose of setting up for some
scene later on where he breaks from that character and realizes that "OMG they
value me for my intelligence! I'm not useless!", and sure as "anime always has
that low fucking framerate" it happens about ten episodes in.

Within one or two episodes you've got all you need to anticipate every movement
and reaction of one of the main characters without fault. What. The. Fuck.

Mikasa isn't much better, she's just given a different set of defining points:

1. Be rather silent and mysterious. Generally stand still turned away from the
   camera when talking. Let your hair blow gently in the wind and cover half of
   your face with a scarf. Anime fans will love that shit.
2. Be superbly proficient at **everything** you do. This goes very well with
   the mysteriousness and it'll make you a good side kick.
3. Due to Eren being the last piece of family you've got, never ever take
   a different path in life than what he takes. Also, have no regard for
   whether it's appropriate to have this attitude, so even if the situation
   calls for some flexibility your obsession with having him around should
   always go first.
4. Actually, don't express much emotions for anything except for the presence,
   vicinity or well being of Eren.

As viewers we're provided with a flashback to when Mikasa was a kid, when her
parents were murdered in front of her and she was abducted so she could be sold
off for "her oriental blood" (which due to the setting is a rare thing). Eren
comes around with a knife, kills all but one guy who tries to strangle him.
Mikasa picks up the knife, freezes up, hears Erin stutter out (while in a choke
hold) that "if she doesn't fight, she can't win", which is apparently enough to
change her life, giving her the mental fortitude to kill Eren's assailant.

That's all we're given when it comes to character development for the second
most prominent character. She never changes, never ventures outside of her
defined "role" and certainly does what is expected of her when she thinks that
Eren has died:

1. Becomes uncharacteristically reckless? Check.
2. Fucks up due to this recklessness? Check.
3. Loses all will to live? Check.
4. Suddenly remembers important words from Eren which gives her strength to
   snap out of the apathy? Abso-fucking-lutely.

Eren is probably the only fleshed out character that gets to have an arc. We
get to see his origins, his motivations, his failures and convictions. There's
actually some depth to him. Sure there are some clich√©s, but you don't
complain when he's one of the few characters that feel three dimensional.

You know it's bad when characters that have very little screen time become more
interesting than major characters, because by hardly knowing anything about
them you get to fill in the blanks and turn them into real characters on your
own.

### Jarring behaviour of characters

There isn't a single non-imbecile who'd think that when everyone around you is
standing on attention with a drill sergeant shouting you, it would be a good
idea to eat a potato. Not even furtively, just eating with no shame.

I wouldn't expect any officer worth his rank to completely lose his shit when
looking at three kids, even if one of them is a human that could *potentially*
transform into something menacing (which he hadn't at that point). This despite
having a large amount of cannons and a full troop poised and ready to strike at
this tiny group of people. While the officer in question is freaking the fuck
out, most of the low ranked soldiers are collected.

I wouldn't think that after three years of training at a boot camp that has
people **dying** during the exercises (among other things) you'd still have
skinny, pigtails wearing, squeaky "Sailor-Moon-esque" girls around that look
like they're twelve years old and wouldn't be able to stand up with the gear
they have to fight with, and yet here we are.

Having a possibly fifty-or-more years old baron behave like a spoiled child,
complete with the whining makes for very weird scenes.

The list just goes on and on. It's as if none of the writes stopped to think
"What would a real person do in this situation, not an anime character?".

### The fucking over-dramatization

{% blockquote Most animes %}
HOLY SHIT GUYS, something important just happened so we'd better slow down time, blur out the sides of the screen and put in some speed-lines like we're in fucking warp drive and zoom in on someone's eyes. IT'S ABOUT TO GET REAL!
{% endblockquote %}

This shit is what makes me apprehensive of recommending any anime to anyone not
into the genre. If you had a scale of emotional intensity from zero to ten
(regardless of whether we're talking about negative or positive feelings),
writers of anime put a great deal of effort into wiping out everything that
could be over in three-to-seven-land. The camera angles, the zooming in on
people's eyes as soon as something could elicit a reaction, the five minute
shot of someone being so furious shit could spontaneously combust around that
character, the *gallons* of tears people seem to store somewhere inside
themselves and the bipolarity that seems to be a completely normal trait to
slap onto a character.

It's as if the writers were convinced that the viewers are so completely inept
at picking up subtleties that the audio and imagery needs to *scream* the
message for a prolonged time for them to be certain that it'll penetrate.

It's either that, or it could be blatant laziness. There's a scene where Mikasa
has recently been informed that the only person she cares about (Eren) has died
and therefore goes on a sorrow fueled, uncharacteristically careless, hunt for
titans.  
Sounds decent right? Stoic character shows weakness due to loss through her
different style in battle, until eventually this emotional way of conducting
battle causes her to loose control. Would be cool to see that right?

Except that doesn't happen. Instead we get Armin *fucking telling* us exactly
that. "Oh look, she copes with her loss by taking it out on the titans. She's
flying recklessly so she'll run out of gas if she keeps this up."  
This *could* have been expressed with finesse, but fuck that, that's not how
it's done in anime-land.

## Please don't do this

The worst part about this is that it's an interesting setting to work with. The
art style is solid and there's a lot of stories that could be told about this
world. If Production I.G managed to pull off Ghost in the Shell, then they
obviously have the ability to turn it into something genuinely good.

Instead we get something that is marred by all of the different anime-isms that
get shoved into it. When you've cut away all of the mold, there's not much left
of the loaf of bread, even if what's left is really tasty.
