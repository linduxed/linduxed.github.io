At times I forget why I loved a certain artist or composition. The same happens
with books, video games and movies. Time has passed and having indulged in the
work of art so many times made me forget what made it so special in the first
place.

About a year ago I veered away from my tried and true collection of
instrumental music and found new joy in the world of dance music, ranging from
electro-swing like Parov Stelar to house like Deadmau5. Ambient music soon
followed, since I had been in contact with the genre before and video game
music (as wide ranging as that is) also became quite prominent in my playlists.

It was all a major departure; I had probably grown tired of listening to the
same artists and tracks. I needed a change.

The more I think about it however, the more I see similarities creep up between
the old and the new. Even though I crossed genres, I still can't shake core
tastes. No prominent vocals, generally some powerful riff or sample and
a strong groove that carries the track. I know that's very general and probably
doesn't mean much, but the point is that once I had settled down in these new
genres, I realized that I hadn't been looking for something all that different.
This made me revisit the things I had moved away from, and it turned out that
my love for them had been rekindled.

I think one really needs to take a break from the familiar from time to time to
appreciate it fully. It's a clich√©, yes, but apparently it needs to be
experienced before it's understood.

Just an observation, that's all.
