    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I went to see Dylan Moran yesterday.<br/>
I was quite hesitant at first to order the ticket, having two exams the same
week. In retrospect however, I would never be able to forgive myself for not
taking the opportunity to see my favorite comedian, bar none.</p>

<p>Me and my friend <a href="http://www.pinheadlounge.com/FreddyBoy">FreddyBoy</a> (with whom
I went to see the performance) are the type of people who have seen the
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0262150/">Black Books series</a> somewhere around
four times over, and we&rsquo;ve both lost count on how many times we&rsquo;ve seen the
standups <a href="http://youtu.be/HNAh9_BPBFk">Like, Totally</a> and <a href="http://youtu.be/lpkiIaFv5As">Monster</a> (playlist). This inevitably made us wonder whether
we would have to sit through an amalgamation of all the punchlines we knew by
heart, even though this was a part of a new tour called <a href="http://youtu.be/hieTxQ0oJPc">What it is</a> (link recently added).</p>

<p>All my hesitation was gone within the first few minutes, and I was quickly
reminded why Black Books was the first TV-series that had me laughing into
pain. I spent a bit more than two hours listening to witty sarcasm and
interesting views of our everyday lives, and I just kept wanting more. The main
theme was what a person is to believe in, in this turbulent world of ours.
Science, religion and politics were discarded in favor of pleasure. Naturally,
the performance took different directions at times, which only served to make
the show more interesting.</p>

<p>Dylan Moran is a master of comedy. What puts him among the legends is the
unpredictability and his lapidary way of portraying the world around him.<br/>
The first mentioned trait is what has made me stop appreciating and literally
avoid American comedy. Often I both know every word that is going to be said,
and how it is going to be said. Indeed it might have been entertaining the
first or second time, but that&rsquo;s where it ends.</p>

<p>Brittish comedy often challenges the audience, asks it to try to keep up with
the twists and turns created by the authors. Unpredictability creates interest
because it gives us something to explore. But what if the world explored is
a bland one? That is where Moran is able to use a few select words to
exaggerate it into a caricature which grabs your attention, seemingly out of
nowhere.</p>

<p>No matter how much I love this man&rsquo;s work however, I have to point out that it
seems the ones sharing my taste are rather few. The majority of friends I&rsquo;ve
shown Moran&rsquo;s work for have sat for lengthy amounts of time wondering where the
fun is to be had. Take it as both a warning and an invitation.</p>

<p>When Moran is speaking, I listen. You should too.</p>

    <updated>2009-05-29T04:02:16+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://linduxed.com/blog/2009/05/29/no-vista-no-gaming-hate-vista-love-gaming</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my last entry I described my nocturnal attempts at installing an OS. After
a little closer reflection, I shouldn&rsquo;t have been so quick to blame the distros
for dodgy discs and weird installs, sleep depravity and lack of will to fix
issues (which were bound to arise) don&rsquo;t give you privileges to fling poo at
good OSs.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Now, I&rsquo;ve grown used to certain things when it comes to GNU/Linux, one of the
most prominent being that certain hardware takes some work to get working. I&rsquo;ve
got a rather new sound card, that causes problems. My wireless card was also
quite problematic (as in wasn&rsquo;t compatible) until the 2.6.28 kernel.<br/>
This is quite explainable, there&rsquo;s rarely official support so the more
ambitious geeks around the world hero-code, so that we have anything at all.
A remarkable job is done in this respect.</p>

<p>This leads me to be thoroughly pissed when a certain OS gets treated with
official drivers to every damn component in a computer and still doesn&rsquo;t work
as intended.</p>

<p>After the events described in the last entry, with some magic tools I recovered
the most necessary files out of the Windows partition, and decided to reinstall
the system. Not the most thrilling task I could have imagined but what&rsquo;s
a gamer got to do?</p>

<h2>The install, and some love for Vista</h2>

<p>Before I go into the details of my setting up my game station, I&rsquo;d like to point out that Acer made me a real favour when I bought the laptop:</p>

<p>The only Windows version that has full driver support for this computer turns out to be Vista.</p>

<p>Truly, I couldn&rsquo;t be more thankful, because what the hell else would manage to
force me into the &ldquo;next generation&rdquo; of Microsoft&rsquo;s flagship products? I&rsquo;m quite
sure I wouldn&rsquo;t have done it voluntarily. So in my case, I was installing Vista
Business 64.</p>

<p>I could elaborate on my issues with Vista, but would I have done so the site
would most likely close after one or two visitors; I have monthly bandwidth cap
at 125 GB. I&rsquo;ll write a summary at some point however.</p>

<p>The installation of the system itself was thankfully straightforward, but
that&rsquo;s where the fun stopped. Ubuntu is in a way forced to have an absolutely
stellar auto detection of hardware, to avoid having Windows converts shit their
breeches at the prospect of actually doing anything with their new system.</p>

<p>Microsoft on the other hand is in no way forced to do any drivers whatsoever,
that is left to the hardware vendors. This is not something one can hold
against them, with drivers for Windows having preposterous sizes these days,
you wouldn&rsquo;t have space for anything else on a DVD, especially an OS as space
&ldquo;efficient&rdquo; as Windows.<br/>
Some might now argue they should at least be treated with proper default
drivers with all the space the OS takes&hellip;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the expense of what?&rdquo; says linduxed in a sarcastic voice.<br/>
&ldquo;A fresh install of Vista takes roughly 16 GB of disk space, at such a miniscule size it has to be chock-full of crucial code! How would you fit said drivers? You know that you only have the space of a DVD to install from, right?</p>

<p>What would you cut?<br/>
With such a delicate and cutting edge system you&rsquo;d have to make some big
decisions! What would Vista be without the <code>do_nothing_loop()</code> methods? Or the
<code>hang_system()</code> calls? Would you seriously dare to boot up your computer if you
knew that Microsoft decided to cut the <code>do_some_stuff()</code> method?<br/>
Proper default drivers are simply not feasible, and hearing some people
suggesting that an OS should have applications included to actually be able to
do something with the god damn thing is preposterous.&#8221;</p>

<h4>Returning to the installation&hellip;</h4>

<p>So as soon as the system was installed I was greeted with a slow and stone
age-resolution touting desktop. I came prepared however, and plugged in my
USB-drive, which I had previously filled with drivers. It is worth to mention
that these were the official drivers, downloaded from the Acer website.</p>

<p>Having installed some Windows systems by now, I knew that some drivers are
arrogant pricks, which absolutely demand that no other drivers are installed
before reboot. If I don&rsquo;t listen to them, I&rsquo;ll end up with anything between the
driver not installing at all, and not being able to shutdown properly.<br/>
I counted four pricks, three annoying bastards, and the rest (close to ten)
were of the nicer kind. This led to about five or six guaranteed reboots, and
then came the unforeseen ones on top of that.</p>

<p>The ones which were in a particularly fickle mood were the sound and graphics
drivers. Both thought getting installed was such a thrill they demanded to go
through the ride three times each, every time craving a reboot. I wasn&rsquo;t in the
mood for more, and apparently the web cam interpreted the grinding of teeth as
a sign to have mr. Sound and mr. Graphics to stop dicking around.</p>

<h2>Concluding</h2>

<p>I lost count of all the reboots, but in the end that doesn&rsquo;t matter, because
after the installation of drivers I still had &ldquo;features&rdquo; to turn off (UAC,
anyone?), applications to install and settings to set up. That is however not
really a part of the installation itself in my opinion.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m past it now and have gotten my games to work, but I know that it&rsquo;s just
a matter of time before I&rsquo;ll bump into this process again. When I move to
Windows 7 (and I will, I doubt it can get worse than Vista), I suspect I&rsquo;ll
have the same issues.</p>

<p>I guess another rant will be needed at that time then.</p>

    <link href="http://linduxed.com/blog/2009/05/26/late-night-os-adventures/"/>
    <updated>2009-05-26T22:30:23+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://linduxed.com/blog/2009/05/26/late-night-os-adventures</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So it was a late night, a day or so after the 23rd of April, Jaunty had just
been released. I was very excited because I had been using Intrepid for
a while, and I wasn&rsquo;t as satisfied with it as I was with Hardy; an upgrade felt
like a nice thing to do. It turned out that Jaunty had some issues that I at the
time felt relatively unmotivated to solve, most notably <a href="http://linduxed.com/blog/2009/05/24/sound-in-ubuntu-9-dot-04-on-acer-aspire-8930g/">no sound</a> and an
<a href="http://linduxed.com/blog/2009/05/25/getting-awesome-3-dot-x-in-ubuntu-9-dot-04/">inability to install Awesome</a>.</p>

<p>Perfect reason to start distrohopping.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>3 x Linux vs. Eyelids</h2>

<p>Debian was first up. I burned a stable Lenny ISO, rebooted, turned out i burned
a dodgy CD, wouldn&rsquo;t boot.<br/>
I instantly decided that I didn&rsquo;t care for Debian since it wouldn&rsquo;t boot,
making it the most uncalled for discarding of a piece of software this year.</p>

<p>Next up was Intrepid, mainly because it worked to a larger extent than Jaunty.
Obviously, the tired linduxed decided after a quick installation that getting
the sound to work in Intrepid would not be fun (despite knowing that it would
need tweaking regardless of distro), so Intrepid was also discarded.</p>

<p>Two systems in less than an hour, both cases making no sense whatsoever; that
must be a record of some sort.</p>

<p>Next up was Arch. I really like this system, but I should have known better
than setting up an OS pretty much from scratch when I was so tired I had
trouble locating my hands.</p>

<p>I somehow managed to progress all the way up to the partitioning stage, which in retrospect I can&rsquo;t decide if it was a good or a bad thing.<br/>
I came to the reasonable conclusion that having both a /home-partition and
a /-partition might be superior to just having a /-partition. What was not as
reasonable was to start formatting partitions and editing individual cylinder
values while my brain tried to make it clear to me that the numbers and letters
had transformed into hamburgers and frisbees.</p>

<p>This basically lead to corrupting the entire partition table, which made me call it a day.</p>

<h3>Stroke of luck</h3>

<p>The next morning I could confirm that I had no systems to boot into and that my brain was still in the mood for illogical decisions:</p>

<p>It was time to install Jaunty again!</p>

<p>Why? Because this time everything was going to work, I said to myself.
A generously flawed assumption, but it turns out I was right. Apparently Ubuntu
seeks to comfort Windows converts by being just as unpredictable, all the
issues I had in the previous install of Jaunty seemed to fix themselves, an
interesting feat indeed.</p>

<p>So the distrohopping ended happily, but what happened to Windows? A geek has to
game right?</p>

    <link href="http://linduxed.com/blog/2009/05/25/getting-awesome-3-dot-x-in-ubuntu-9-dot-04/"/>
    <updated>2009-05-25T17:19:06+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://linduxed.com/blog/2009/05/25/getting-awesome-3-dot-x-in-ubuntu-9-dot-04</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Awesome is awesome. That simple. The 3.x series introduced a tray which removed
all hesitation and made Awesome the WM of choice for me. Unfortunately for
Ubuntu users (which for the time being includes me) the official repositories
are quite outdated:</p>

<!--more-->




<blockquote><p>&#8230;</p><p>In contrast to pre-release versions, official releases of Ubuntu are subject to<br/>much wider use, and by a different demographic of user. During development,<br/>changes to the distribution primarily affect developers, early adopters and<br/>other advanced users, all of whom have elected to use pre-release software at<br/>their own risk.</p><p>Users of the official release, in contrast, expect a high degree of stability.<br/>They use their Ubuntu system for their day-to-day work, and problems they<br/>experience with it can be extremely disruptive. Many of them are less<br/>experienced with Ubuntu and with Linux, and expect a reliable system which does<br/>not require their intervention.</p><p>&#8230;</p><footer><strong>Ubuntu package policy</strong> <cite><a href='http://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates'>wiki.ubuntu.com/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>That in other words means that anyone suggesting the introduction of new
versions of existing packages has to pass the hurdle of &ldquo;is this a stability
release or a feature release?&rdquo;. This is why the 3.x series, though superior in
most ways to 2.x, will wait until Karmic Koala before it will be incorporated
into Ubuntu&rsquo;s repositories.</p>

<p>With that said, there are two ways of getting Awesome 3.x installed onto
Jaunty. The first one is using a PPA and the other one is compiling from
source.</p>

<h2>Using a PPA</h2>

<p>This is the easiest method, because not only does it eliminate the search for
dependencies but it is also a method that is tested to work with Jaunty (to the
extent of the PPA maintainers ability of course).</p>

<p>To install from the PPA you must first add it. The PPA we&rsquo;re going to use
belongs to <a href="https://launchpad.net/~aguignard/+archive/ppa">Arnaud Guignard and lies here</a>. If you have never added a PPA
then <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUZOQsNo_ws">this YouTube video</a> will
explain how to do it quite thoroughly; written instructions can be found
<a href="http://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA#Adding%20a%20PPA%20to%20your%20Ubuntu%20repositories">here</a>.</p>

<p>After adding the repository, simply type the following command:</p>

<pre><code>sudo aptitude install awesome
</code></pre>

<p>This should get you at the time of writing the <code>3.2.1-1~ppa1</code> version of
Awesome. All you need to do is log out and choose Awesome as the session to use
in in your desktop manager (<code>gdm</code>, <code>kdm</code> or whatever you use).</p>

<h2>Compiling from git</h2>

<p>This method I personally don&rsquo;t recommend, simply because using the PPA is so
much easier and it should work flawlessly. With that said, I suspect that most
people who use Awesome in Ubuntu compile it to get the latest
version, so it&rsquo;s by no means a bad way to do it.</p>

<p>A thing to take note of is that this will most likely screw up your package
manager, because we might be overwriting packages and at times installing
packages that are newer than the ones in the repositories. If at some point you
install some package that overwrite your manually installed files, tough, you
should have used the PPA.</p>

<p>With that out of the way, the instructions I used to install the latest
checkout are located on the <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=960841">Ubuntu forums</a>, it&rsquo;s basically a step by step guide.</p>

<p>The only thing I&rsquo;d like to add is that there is a nice way of remedying at
least some of the problems associated with compiling and doing <code>sudo make
install</code>, and it&rsquo;s the marvelous utility called <code>checkinstall.</code> First you need
to run the following command to obtain it:</p>

<pre><code>sudo aptitude install checkinstall
</code></pre>

<p>After that, whenever the you are asked to do the classic <code>./configure &amp;&amp; make
&amp;&amp; sudo make install</code>, substitute the <code>sudo make install</code> with <code>sudo
checkinstall</code>.</p>

<p>This will instead of dropping files outside of the package manager, build
a <code>.deb</code> that can then be installed (thus eliminating some problems). This
doesn&rsquo;t always work (for reasons I can&rsquo;t explain) but it is a wholesome way of
installing when it does. A more detailed guide to <code>checkinstall</code> can be found
<a href="http://help.ubuntu.com/community/CheckInstall">here</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://linduxed.com/blog/2009/05/24/sound-in-ubuntu-9-dot-04-on-acer-aspire-8930g/"/>
    <updated>2009-05-24T18:56:20+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://linduxed.com/blog/2009/05/24/sound-in-ubuntu-9-dot-04-on-acer-aspire-8930g</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Acer Aspire 8930g has got a sound card that has not only been unsupported
in GNU/Linux for a long time, it has also (to this day) never been a case of
having the card work out of the box in any distro.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s basically a &ldquo;Intel HD Audio Controller&rdquo; and uses the ALC889 codec. Support
for this card was, according to the alsa-project.org mailing lists,
incorporated in the 1.0.16 driver, receiving updates every version since.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I&rsquo;ve experimented with various driver versions and so far I can only conclude
the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>alsa-1.0.18</code> driver is the first one to show any signs of working, let
alone properly.</li>
<li>Of the ones I&rsquo;ve tried only <code>1.0.19</code> has managed to auto configure properly.</li>
</ul>


<p>Since ALC889 is universally seen as a problematic codec, don&rsquo;t expect anything.
If any one of these methods work, rejoice, if they don&rsquo;t I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m
surprised.</p>

<h2>Different methods of installing</h2>

<p>The first thing you need to do is to make sure you have the ALC889 codec:</p>

<pre><code>cat /proc/asound/card*/codec\#* | grep -i codec
</code></pre>

<p>If it&rsquo;s the correct codec it should return something like <code>Codec: Realtek ALC889</code>.
From here there are three four methods to get sound, three of which I&rsquo;ve tried myself.
After each one, the following <a href="http://www.lynnepublishing.com/surround/www_lynnemusic_com_surround_test.ac3">surround sound testing audio file</a>
can be used to check the result.</p>

<h3>First method: Editing the modprobe.d configuration</h3>

<p>Make sure you have the latest stable alsa-base package, that is
1.0.18.dfsg-1ubuntu8. This should be installed with Jaunty, but to check type
the following:</p>

<pre><code>aptitude show alsa-base
</code></pre>

<p>This should return (amongst other information) the correct version number. If
not, run the following:</p>

<pre><code>sudo aptitude safe-upgrade
</code></pre>

<p>This should get you the latest stable (provided you have the main repository
enabled). With that fixed, you should edit /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base:</p>

<pre><code>sudo vim /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf
</code></pre>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t use Vim, do. In absolute emergency <code>nano</code> may be used.
Add this to the end of the file:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>alias snd-card-0 snd-hda-intel
</span><span class='line'>options snd-hda-intel model=auto</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>A reboot should now be sufficient, if this method works for you that is.
Remember to go into <code>alsamixer</code> to unmute and pull up all the different
sliders.</p>

<p>As a footnote I might add that this gave me splendid sound on the left, right
and center channels. This setup is most likely enough for most people, but my
laptop is a 5.1 Dolby so I don&rsquo;t get the full experience. Currently, this is no
problem for me, but I know some will find this suboptimal, if this is the case,
move to the third method.</p>

<h3>Second method: Using the ALSA Upgrade Script</h3>

<p>This method helped me get sound when it didn&rsquo;t work in Intrepid, in Jaunty this
didn&rsquo;t work for me.</p>

<p>Basically this method comes down to using a script that downloads, compiles and
installs the latest ALSA driver (at the point of writing, version <code>1.0.20</code>).<br/>
The method has no prerequisites with regards to the installed driver, because
of the fact that it compiles and installs the old fashioned way. This also
means that the script will screw up your package manager when it comes to the
ALSA packages. Versions, dependencies and all that stuff will be configured
&ldquo;outside of the system&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Basically, if it works then you won&rsquo;t want to upgrade anything through the
package manager; if it doesn&rsquo;t work the script comes with an inbuilt feature
that reverts to whatever the system looked like before installing with it. So
if you don&rsquo;t get sound after installing with this method, uninstall.</p>

<p>The script and much more thorough instructions can be found in the
<a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1046137">thread created by soundcheck</a>.</p>

<h3>Third method: Compiling the official Realtek Driver</h3>

<p>This method I have not tried in Jaunty, so I can&rsquo;t speak from my own
experience. It has no prerequisites with regards to installed drivers and
according some googling, this method should provide the full Dolby 5.1,
including the Tuba subwoofer.<br/>
It comes down to using the official Realtek drivers found
<a href="http://www.realtek.com.tw/downloads/downloadsView.aspx?Langid=1&amp;PNid=24&amp;PFid=24&amp;Level=4&amp;Conn=3&amp;DownTypeID=3&amp;GetDown=false">here</a>
(check the &ldquo;accept box&rdquo;, press next, and download the Linux driver on the
bottom). When the driver is downloaded and extracted, there are according to
<a href="http://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/218165">this bugreport</a> two ways of
installing.</p>

<p>The first one is basically to open the Readme.txt file and follow the Ubuntu
instructions step-by-step.</p>

<p>The second one is to opt for what in the Readme.txt file is described as
&ldquo;recommended for Redhat and RH-derivative distributions&rdquo;. <code>cd</code> into the extracted
directory and type:</p>

<pre><code>sudo ./install
</code></pre>

<p>After completing the process, reboot, and subsequently type:</p>

<pre><code>sudo alsaconf
</code></pre>

<p>The only thing to do after this should be to adjust the settings in the
<code>alsamixer</code>, where after sound should be enabled on all speakers. As stated
above, I can&rsquo;t confirm this.</p>

<h3>Fourth method: The hda-verb utility</h3>

<p>This method I see as a last resort because it results in a low volume, mono
sound, coming from only the right and left speaker. You will also have no
access to the headphone jack, nor will the microphone work.</p>

<p>I have no idea what the prerequisites are, but since you&rsquo;ve installed ALSA two
to three times by now if you&rsquo;re at this stage, I&rsquo;d guess you have all that&rsquo;s
needed on your system. Last time I tried this method I used Arch Linux so
I can&rsquo;t confirm it will work on Jaunty.</p>

<p>Download and extract <code>hda-verb-0.3.tar.gz</code>:</p>

<pre><code>wget ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/tiwai/misc/hda-verb-0.3.tar.gz
tar xzvf hda-verb-0.3.tar.gz
</code></pre>

<p><code>cd</code> into the directory and run the following:</p>

<pre><code>./hda-verb /dev/snd/hwC0D0 0x15 SET_EAPD_BTLENABLE 2
</code></pre>

<p>You might need <code>sudo</code> for that command to work. That should, after some
<code>alsamixer</code> adjustments, result in the above mentioned sub-par sound.</p>

<p>To make this occur on every boot you&rsquo;d need to copy the <code>hda-verb</code> application
to <code>/usr/local/bin</code> and insert the following line on the bottom of
<code>/etc/rc.local</code> (but before the <code>exit 0</code> line):</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>/usr/local/bin/hda-verb /dev/snd/hwC0D0 0x15 SET_EAPD_BTLENABLE 2</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This automation didn&rsquo;t work for me though, and at times the device <code>hwC0D0</code>
disappeared, making the command ineffective, forcing me to reboot if I wanted
sound.</p>

<h2>Concluding</h2>

<p>By now the ALC889 has been around for a while and solutions for this codec
have become easier and easier, hopefully the guys at ALSA will soon have it
auto configure all the speakers for everyone using this laptop. If none of
these methods work for you I encourage you to google the problem, the Intel HD
Audio cards are being pushed into more and more computers, so solutions should
be aplenty.</p>

<p>I have contemplated the creation of this site for the longest time, but never got around doing it.
I&rsquo;m not a perfectionist by nature, but there are certain areas that I get very meticulous about, most often areas that I already know how to maneuver in, where I can have a reasonable and educated opinion. Design, while not being an expertise of any sort, is one of those areas; my page had to look and work great for me to bear with it.
Additionally, I was always bridled by the thought that my writing bore close to no relevance, interesting to me almost exclusively.</p>

<p>The first problem was solved by Squarespace (or indirectly by CO-OP, an amazing game-show that had SS as a sponsor). Not only did it help me to create a design I could feel content with, but it also gives me powerful tools to manage all aspects of the page in a simple way. This might not be a final design, nor might it be the last hosting service I&rsquo;m using, but I&rsquo;m very pleased with what I&rsquo;ve got now.</p>

<p>The second problem, while more profound, was solved swiftly over the course of a few days about half a year ago, namely when I began my scholarship at KTH.
I do believe that most of my Computer Science friends will agree when I say that we are, to a large extent, a congregation of geeks. I, for the most parts of my life, have found myself being the nerd of the pack; a nerd with the uncanny skill of being able to communicate with human beings, but nonetheless a nerd at his finest.
The things running through my head we&rsquo;re neither of others concern nor of their interest. Not the case where I&rsquo;m now.</p>

<h2>What the future holds</h2>

<p>So with a page up, and incentive to write, two questions arise: What and how?</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t predict what path this site of mine will take, but I know my current intentions. The two main sections will be the Journal and the Notes. The Notes section will be where articles, tutorials and reviews will be stored, expect tech-related work. The Journal on the other hand will be taking care of the white noise running through my head, or at least the portion that gets transcribed.
Hopefully, these two in conjunction will have me coming back to add more content. That concludes the &ldquo;What&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rdquo; is a question regarding language. My main audience will undoubtedly be Swedish, but the things I&rsquo;ll write will most likely concern an international audience, regardless of how slim it may be. Knowing that we Swedes are really good at English, I&rsquo;ve decided I&rsquo;ll start off English only. I suspect I will sooner or later add a Swedish section of some sort, but I can&rsquo;t say anything for sure.
End of beginning</p>

<p>To wrap this first post up, I want to say that my hope is that the website I&rsquo;ve created will some day be revered for the marvelous content it regularly gets updated with. One can only hope&hellip;</p>
