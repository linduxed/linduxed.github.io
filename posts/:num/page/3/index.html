  <div class="entry-content"><p>Humour is a force that binds and divides.</p>

<p>It is as hard to define as the force of love and yet as simple. When you burst
out into an honest laughter, just as with love, it just happens.<br/>
Similarly, what may be infatuating for one, might be repulsive to the other.
I expect everyone to have wondered why person next to them is laughing, just as
I expect most people to have encountered love they cannot understand.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Within the genre of first person shooters there is a sub-genre that are often
called arena shooters.</p>

<p>Arena shooters focus on dropping you and a bunch of opponents into enclosed
arenas with a bunch weapons with the sole objective of making your opponents
less intact than you are. With such a simple premise, the creators of such
games are forced to make the basics right, the core shooting and the movement
in the world. The expectations on the breadth of the game are lowered in favor
of a perfect &ldquo;feel&rdquo;. Only when the very basics are perfect, the creators start
thinking about adding new gameplay elements on top of the foundation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m by now profoundly tired of the misconception that has been floating around
in our modern digitalized society for too long of a time. It thrives within the
older generations, but is in no way limited to them. It goes like this:</p>

<h4>Piracy is theft!</h4>

<p>Stop. <strong>Now</strong>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After posting my guide on installing Awesome 3.x I got the inevitable question
of how to actually configure it. This WM is not for the faint of heart.<br/>
On the other hand it does offer a lot of customization, should you know the lua
programming language. I for one don&rsquo;t, but that didn&rsquo;t stop me from tweaking
the defaults, and for most people that will be enough to get them started.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve for some time now looked at extreme sides in conflicts/discussions as
a kind of a necessity. It&rsquo;s not that you will always agree with them, but they
will inevitably broaden the scope of the argument.<br/>
I might, for instance, not agree with right-wing extremists, but having them
there forces one into debates that would otherwise never be had, opening ones
eyes to opinions outside what is seen as &ldquo;normal&rdquo;.</p>

<p>It was this kind of blindness to other opinion that permeated the Swedish
(although not in any way limited to) politics when it came to a certain
subject:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When Unreal Tournament 3 was officially announced, a wave of mixed feelings
went through the Unreal-community.</p>

<p>UT2004 was essentially everything most people could have ever wanted in terms
of a shooter. Sure, there were going to be UT99 purists who would object to the
style and the zealous Quake gamers who still claim that after Q3 the world
could have stopped spinning, but disregarding people who would never have it
any different than graphically updated clones, UT2004 was a milestone in FPS
gaming. The mechanics were done right, the content was abundant, the community
was sprawling and everything was kept at a impressively high standard. Within
UT2004 we had almost everything we could ask for.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;ve only been playing UT3 for the &ldquo;Play UT3 for free!&rdquo;-weekends offered on Steam. Since these have occurred twice I&rsquo;ve got somewhere around 20 hours of total play time. I therefore don&rsquo;t feel entitled to a final opinion, but I want to share my observations.</p>

I was quite hesitant at first to order the ticket, having two exams the same

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my last entry I described my nocturnal attempts at installing an OS. After
a little closer reflection, I shouldn&rsquo;t have been so quick to blame the distros
for dodgy discs and weird installs, sleep depravity and lack of will to fix
issues (which were bound to arise) don&rsquo;t give you privileges to fling poo at
good OSs.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So it was a late night, a day or so after the 23rd of April, Jaunty had just
been released. I was very excited because I had been using Intrepid for
a while, and I wasn&rsquo;t as satisfied with it as I was with Hardy; an upgrade felt
like a nice thing to do. It turned out that Jaunty had some issues that I at the
time felt relatively unmotivated to solve, most notably <a href="/blog/2009/05/24/sound-in-ubuntu-9-dot-04-on-acer-aspire-8930g/">no sound</a> and an
<a href="/blog/2009/05/25/getting-awesome-3-dot-x-in-ubuntu-9-dot-04/">inability to install Awesome</a>.</p>

<p>Perfect reason to start distrohopping.</p>
