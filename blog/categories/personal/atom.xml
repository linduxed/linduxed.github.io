    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At times I forget why I loved a certain artist or composition. The same happens
with books, video games and movies. Time has passed and having indulged in the
work of art so many times made me forget what made it so special in the first
place.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>About a year ago I veered away from my tried and true collection of
instrumental music and found new joy in the world of dance music, ranging from
electro-swing like Parov Stelar to house like Deadmau5. Ambient music soon
followed, since I had been in contact with the genre before and video game
music (as wide ranging as that is) also became quite prominent in my playlists.</p>

<p>It was all a major departure; I had probably grown tired of listening to the
same artists and tracks. I needed a change.</p>

<p>The more I think about it however, the more I see similarities creep up between
the old and the new. Even though I crossed genres, I still can&rsquo;t shake core
tastes. No prominent vocals, generally some powerful riff or sample and
a strong groove that carries the track. I know that&rsquo;s very general and probably
doesn&rsquo;t mean much, but the point is that once I had settled down in these new
genres, I realized that I hadn&rsquo;t been looking for something all that different.
This made me revisit the things I had moved away from, and it turned out that
my love for them had been rekindled.</p>

<p>I think one really needs to take a break from the familiar from time to time to
appreciate it fully. It&rsquo;s a cliché, yes, but apparently it needs to be
experienced before it&rsquo;s understood.</p>

<p>Just an observation, that&rsquo;s all.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently my co-worker recommended me an anime series called &ldquo;Attack on Titan&rdquo;.
The clips on Youtube looked good; the style was pretty cool, it looked like an
interesting setting and it looked like the focus was on people trying to
survive in a tough world.</p>

<p>Having seen all of the currently released episodes, I can say that all of the
above is true! The style, the setting, the story; all of that is there and is
enjoyable.</p>

<p>The big issue with the series is that all of above mentioned qualities are
wrapped in the shitty package of being an anime.</p>

<p>Spoilers ahead.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>So much shit I had forgotten</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve gone through a decent share of anime and it strikes me that the longer
you&rsquo;re away from it the harder it is to get back into it. It&rsquo;s like you build
up a kind of immunity to all the bullshit that is endemic to the genre.</p>

<h3>The two dimensional characters</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m fine with characters who speak once every third episode or so to only be
defined by some role. &ldquo;He always puts on a facade of cockiness&rdquo;, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
reckless but talented&rdquo; or &ldquo;His loss of family drives his will to improve&rdquo;.</p>

<p>However, when your main characters get no more depth than this, beyond
providing a reason for why they are defined by this &ldquo;role&rdquo; of theirs, then
eventually the show becomes frustratingly predictable.</p>

<p>You have the main guy called Eren, his adopted sister called Mikasa and their
friend called Armin. Let&rsquo;s start with Armin. The character has four defining
features:</p>

<ol>
<li>Being weaker than both of his two friends and therefore frequently getting
help from them throughout his life.</li>
<li>Being smart, getting told that he is, but never internalizing it.</li>
<li>Subsequently feeling inadequate close to his friends, feeling that he&rsquo;s weak
and of little worth.</li>
<li>Looking and sounding so female that had they not used male pronouns to
describe him you&rsquo;d never have guessed. Yes, this more of a pet peeve of
mine, but I&rsquo;m still confused by the androgyny that is sprinkled in from time
to time into anime.</li>
</ol>


<p>That&rsquo;s the entire character. Any scene he participates in (and that&rsquo;s a lot
considering he only gets beat by Eren and <em>maybe</em> Mikasa when it comes to
screen time) you can be damn sure that he&rsquo;ll be feeling inadequate, Erin and
Mikasa will come reassuring him that he&rsquo;s the brains of the pack and he&rsquo;ll have
a moment of silence being surprised about this fact, where after the same shit
will happen in the next scene.<br/>
No effort is made to make the character evolve into anything more than above
points. No flashes of breaking out of the role, no instances of the character
having other talents, just a repetition of the same traits over and over.
Eventually you realize that this all serves the purpose of setting up for some
scene later on where he breaks from that character and realizes that &ldquo;OMG they
value me for my intelligence! I&rsquo;m not useless!&rdquo;, and sure as &ldquo;anime always has
that low fucking framerate&rdquo; it happens about ten episodes in.</p>

<p>Within one or two episodes you&rsquo;ve got all you need to anticipate every movement
and reaction of one of the main characters without fault. What. The. Fuck.</p>

<p>Mikasa isn&rsquo;t much better, she&rsquo;s just given a different set of defining points:</p>

<ol>
<li>Be rather silent and mysterious. Generally stand still turned away from the
camera when talking. Let your hair blow gently in the wind and cover half of
your face with a scarf. Anime fans will love that shit.</li>
<li>Be superbly proficient at <strong>everything</strong> you do. This goes very well with
the mysteriousness and it&rsquo;ll make you a good side kick.</li>
<li>Due to Eren being the last piece of family you&rsquo;ve got, never ever take
a different path in life than what he takes. Also, have no regard for
whether it&rsquo;s appropriate to have this attitude, so even if the situation
calls for some flexibility your obsession with having him around should
always go first.</li>
<li>Actually, don&rsquo;t express much emotions for anything except for the presence,
vicinity or well being of Eren.</li>
</ol>


<p>As viewers we&rsquo;re provided with a flashback to when Mikasa was a kid, when her
parents were murdered in front of her and she was abducted so she could be sold
off for &ldquo;her oriental blood&rdquo; (which due to the setting is a rare thing). Eren
comes around with a knife, kills all but one guy who tries to strangle him.
Mikasa picks up the knife, freezes up, hears Erin stutter out (while in a choke
hold) that &ldquo;if she doesn&rsquo;t fight, she can&rsquo;t win&rdquo;, which is apparently enough to
change her life, giving her the mental fortitude to kill Eren&rsquo;s assailant.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all we&rsquo;re given when it comes to character development for the second
most prominent character. She never changes, never ventures outside of her
defined &ldquo;role&rdquo; and certainly does what is expected of her when she thinks that
Eren has died:</p>

<ol>
<li>Becomes uncharacteristically reckless? Check.</li>
<li>Fucks up due to this recklessness? Check.</li>
<li>Loses all will to live? Check.</li>
<li>Suddenly remembers important words from Eren which gives her strength to
snap out of the apathy? Abso-fucking-lutely.</li>
</ol>


<p>Eren is probably the only fleshed out character that gets to have an arc. We
get to see his origins, his motivations, his failures and convictions. There&rsquo;s
actually some depth to him. Sure there are some clichÃ©s, but you don&rsquo;t
complain when he&rsquo;s one of the few characters that feel three dimensional.</p>

<p>You know it&rsquo;s bad when characters that have very little screen time become more
interesting than major characters, because by hardly knowing anything about
them you get to fill in the blanks and turn them into real characters on your
own.</p>

<h3>Jarring behaviour of characters</h3>

<p>There isn&rsquo;t a single non-imbecile who&rsquo;d think that when everyone around you is
standing on attention with a drill sergeant shouting you, it would be a good
idea to eat a potato. Not even furtively, just eating with no shame.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t expect any officer worth his rank to completely lose his shit when
looking at three kids, even if one of them is a human that could <em>potentially</em>
transform into something menacing (which he hadn&rsquo;t at that point). This despite
having a large amount of cannons and a full troop poised and ready to strike at
this tiny group of people. While the officer in question is freaking the fuck
out, most of the low ranked soldiers are collected.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t think that after three years of training at a boot camp that has
people <strong>dying</strong> during the exercises (among other things) you&rsquo;d still have
skinny, pigtails wearing, squeaky &ldquo;Sailor-Moon-esque&rdquo; girls around that look
like they&rsquo;re twelve years old and wouldn&rsquo;t be able to stand up with the gear
they have to fight with, and yet here we are.</p>

<p>Having a possibly fifty-or-more years old baron behave like a spoiled child,
complete with the whining makes for very weird scenes.</p>

<p>The list just goes on and on. It&rsquo;s as if none of the writes stopped to think
&ldquo;What would a real person do in this situation, not an anime character?&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>The fucking over-dramatization</h3>

<p><blockquote><p>HOLY SHIT GUYS, something important just happened so we&rsquo;d better slow down time, blur out the sides of the screen and put in some speed-lines like we&rsquo;re in fucking warp drive and zoom in on someone&rsquo;s eyes. IT&rsquo;S ABOUT TO GET REAL!</p><footer><strong>Most animes</strong></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>This shit is what makes me apprehensive of recommending any anime to anyone not
into the genre. If you had a scale of emotional intensity from zero to ten
(regardless of whether we&rsquo;re talking about negative or positive feelings),
writers of anime put a great deal of effort into wiping out everything that
could be over in three-to-seven-land. The camera angles, the zooming in on
people&rsquo;s eyes as soon as something could elicit a reaction, the five minute
shot of someone being so furious shit could spontaneously combust around that
character, the <em>gallons</em> of tears people seem to store somewhere inside
themselves and the bipolarity that seems to be a completely normal trait to
slap onto a character.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s as if the writers were convinced that the viewers are so completely inept
at picking up subtleties that the audio and imagery needs to <em>scream</em> the
message for a prolonged time for them to be certain that it&rsquo;ll penetrate.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s either that, or it could be blatant laziness. There&rsquo;s a scene where Mikasa
has recently been informed that the only person she cares about (Eren) has died
and therefore goes on a sorrow fueled, uncharacteristically careless, hunt for
titans.<br/>
Sounds decent right? Stoic character shows weakness due to loss through her
different style in battle, until eventually this emotional way of conducting
battle causes her to loose control. Would be cool to see that right?</p>

<p>Except that doesn&rsquo;t happen. Instead we get Armin <em>fucking telling</em> us exactly
that. &ldquo;Oh look, she copes with her loss by taking it out on the titans. She&rsquo;s
flying recklessly so she&rsquo;ll run out of gas if she keeps this up."<br/>
This <em>could</em> have been expressed with finesse, but fuck that, that&rsquo;s not how
it&rsquo;s done in anime-land.</p>

<h2>Please don&rsquo;t do this</h2>

<p>The worst part about this is that it&rsquo;s an interesting setting to work with. The
art style is solid and there&rsquo;s a lot of stories that could be told about this
world. If Production I.G managed to pull off Ghost in the Shell, then they
obviously have the ability to turn it into something genuinely good.</p>

<p>Instead we get something that is marred by all of the different anime-isms that
get shoved into it. When you&rsquo;ve cut away all of the mold, there&rsquo;s not much left
of the loaf of bread, even if what&rsquo;s left is really tasty.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>En ny vecka gryr och jag står med hopp.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Jobb jag har av varje storlek och slag,<br/>
nog till att fängsla mig natt som dag.</p>

<p>På måndagen är brådska mig främmande.<br/>
Jag lär ej jobba alls, trots att arbetsbördan är skrämmande.</p>

<p>Jag börjar strax, efter lunch, ikväll, inatt.<br/>
Imorgon jobbar jag säkert ifatt.</p>

<p>Tisdag och onsdag far fort likaså,<br/>
jag vet inte ens vad jag skall jobba på.</p>

<p>Vid torsdag morgon är det dags att rappa på,<br/>
halva veckan har gått och resultaten är som bäst små.</p>

<p>Idéerna och visionerna rusar då förbi,<br/>
alla saker som det vore bra om man avklarat i tid.</p>

<p>Men det är ju bara tankar, drömmar som hägrar var dag;<br/>
de ändrar inte något, minst av allt att jag är så svag.</p>

<p>Utan att minnas vad jag gjort, de timmar jag haft allt redo för drift,<br/>
jag sitter där vid midnatt, slagen av min lathet och apatisk som av ett gift.</p>

<p>Natten är dock ej slut för mig, midnatt är blott sen kväll.<br/>
Med småtimmarnas tystnad skall det här väl vara en bagatell?</p>

<p>När fredag dagas är allt för sent och hoppet borta.<br/>
Det enda jag klarade av var att få dagarna att kännas korta.</p>

<p>Skall man ens påbörja dagen när man redan igår var slagen?</p>

<p>Jag kan säkert lura mig själv en dag till,<br/>
“Jag tar igen allt, bara jag vill!”.</p>

<p>Värst är det då jag bara har helgen kvar,<br/>
för det är då tiden som snabbast far.</p>

<p>Flykten från arbete med sig oftast skulden bär,<br/>
men ej på helgen, inte den minsta tyngd på mig tär.</p>

<p>Vet något i mig att ambitioner skall stängas ned? Att lättjan skall skölja över?<br/>
Ohämmad kommer jag göra precis vad jag vill, men ej det jag behöver.</p>

<p>Måndag nalkas och ännu en vecka har försvunnit;<br/>
all den tid man kunde ha använt har mest uti sanden runnit.</p>

<p>Är något annat möjligt?<br/>
Kommer jag att ändras under årets lopp?</p>

<p>Jag kastar bort dessa tankar…</p>

<p>…ty en ny vecka gryr och jag står med hopp.</p>

    <id>http://linduxed.github.io/blog/2010/08/17/just-a-toy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I had an experience that was moving. It felt special, yet to the
casual observer it would have been anything but special.</p>

<p>It involved a <a href="http://www.puzl.co.uk/product_thumb.php?img=images/mini2_3_500.jpg&amp;w=400&amp;h=400">Rubik puzzle</a>
that I hadn’t solved yet, and I just felt like finishing it. After all, I know
how to solve a 2x2x2, so this one shouldn&rsquo;t have posed a problem.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Handle with care</h2>

<p>Inherent to the puzzle&rsquo;s design was that it turned strangely. In some cases the
turns were smooth, in other it felt like the contraption worked against you.
Regardless of it’s intricacies, I treated and used it like a regular 2x2x2; for
me it was as simple as them both being solved in more or less the same way.</p>

<p>So with the first of three “cubes” solved I started twisting and turning the
second one. As mentioned, it was normal that it occasionally stuck and made
a fuss about simple turns, but I kept on going, a couple of time forcing a turn
through instead of wiggling in the opposite direction.<br/>
After some work however, I had the second cube finished and only the last one
remained. Halfway through the third one however it happened.</p>

<p>Something broke.</p>

<p>Something inside the middle cube went loose, and the entire construction along
with it. This was with me being one and a half algorithm away from finishing the
puzzle for the first time.
I clasped the puzzle, realizing that if I let go of any one loose piece, the
entire thing would fall apart. Greedily, all I thought about was solving it,
despite its fragile state. Holding all the pieces on the first and the middle
cube together took a hand and some pressure, making the cube very hard to
maneuver, but this didn&rsquo;t sway me; there was no giving up. Slowly I approached
the last few moves, and I suddenly hit me that this thing was dying.</p>

<p>It was on respirator and intravenous, and I was still pushing it.</p>

<p>To make things worse, I got to be about four turns away from finishing the
entire puzzle when the thing stuck, there was no moving it. It was as if it had
given up; the last turn was made.
Seeing that there was no way to complete the puzzle, despite being so close,
I gave up. Putting it down on the table it went to pieces, its entire structure
crumbling part by part.</p>

<p>It was a strange moment because it felt like I had witnessed and been part of
a toy&rsquo;s death bed experience.</p>

<p>After looking at the pile of coloured plastic I stepped back and reminded myself
that it was just a toy. I left it at that.</p>

    <id>http://linduxed.github.io/blog/2010/05/25/laughs-from-nowhere</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Humour is a force that binds and divides.</p>

<p>It is as hard to define as the force of love and yet as simple. When you burst
out into an honest laughter, just as with love, it just happens.<br/>
Similarly, what may be infatuating for one, might be repulsive to the other.
I expect everyone to have wondered why person next to them is laughing, just as
I expect most people to have encountered love they cannot understand.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Generally, differences in taste of humour are not very much of a problem, but
when your everyday life gets permeated with shit that can only be described as
offensively boring, then there is little room for understanding. A respectful
approach is not an option when mindless attempts at amusement escape the media
and start pouring out onto the street.</p>

<p>There is no way to tell who got the charging freight train of sedative
performances going, but if there is something keeping that train speeding ahead
then it&rsquo;s the american sitcoms and worthless comedians that get too much
publicity. For me there is a crucial element in humour that is both the magic
and vigor of the performance, but it&rsquo;s a rare encounter today:</p>

<h2>Surprise</h2>

<p>The <em>unknown</em>. I need the unexpected because it pulls me out of everyday life
and lets me experience something different, something intriguing in its
peculiarity. The near total absence of surprise in most of (but in no way
limited to) the American humour, is baffling to me. How can this junk survive
(not to mention prosper)?</p>

<p>The answer lies in an entity even more baffling, the <em>viewers</em>. The survival of
these Valium substitute shows could be explained by the fact that people
actually are giving the time to enjoy this turd; there must be many of them.</p>

<p>I get annoyed by having a <em>supposed</em> comedy use jokes that you can smell from
an ocean away and then have them repeated so often that you get to experience
déjà vu every five minutes.<br/>
But these people don&rsquo;t, and they even laugh. Why?</p>

<p>Do they have a lacking comedy experience? Have they never encountered these
laughs? Do they disregard the fact that they know what is about to be said?
Could it be that they don&rsquo;t remember the gags?</p>

<p>Is chronic amnesia is the key to a more joyous life?</p>

<h2>They&rsquo;re everywhere</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve met these people, you have too. You might very well be one of them.
They&rsquo;re normal people that seem to live normal lives, and yet&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not condemning you or anyone else for your taste, but I&rsquo;ve tried for too
long now to understand why people appreciate this unending stream of feces
pretending to be comedy.</p>

<p>Understanding the people around me is something I have to do every day, but
this I just can&rsquo;t grasp.</p>
