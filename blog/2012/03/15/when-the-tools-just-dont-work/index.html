<div class="entry-content"><p>Every once in a while you stumble on that area of software that Linux just
doesn&rsquo;t have covered. You might now be thinking that I&rsquo;d like to talk about
audio and video editing. A fair guess, since you&rsquo;ll hear people talk about
these two as areas where the other platforms have significantly more
sophisticated software available. But this isn&rsquo;t what I&rsquo;m going to talk about.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>You see, I&rsquo;ve had a look at the video and audio editors out there for Linux, and
while it&rsquo;s generally not as good as what you&rsquo;d have on OSX or Windows, there are
projects that make honest efforts to compete (Rosegarden comes to mind). I think
even the cynics can at least call the tools in these areas “rudimentary”.</p>

<p>“Streaming your desktop” in Linux, however, is one area you can&rsquo;t even fucking
call rudimentary. The appropriate description I&rsquo;ve come up with is “technically
working with the help of wizardry”, and I&rsquo;m thinking about whether that&rsquo;s too
generous.</p>

<h2>No audience</h2>

<p>I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m particularly surprised by this situation, because apart from the
occasional recorded screen cast for some brand new package, there isn&rsquo;t that
much of a need, it seems. We don&rsquo;t have the games to stream, which I would
assume is a large part of what drives the revenue of a page like Justin.tv.</p>

<p>I assume most of the people who code in Linux aren&rsquo;t exactly eager to stream and
narrate their work, which could have been that “other area” of content that
would have driven the development of tools for streaming. I understand that the
Linux community might have less scenarios under which one would want to stream
one&rsquo;s desktop, but I&rsquo;m still surprised by how dire the software situation is.</p>

<h2>The tools</h2>

<p>From what I&rsquo;ve gathered, the most “mature” application available for handling
the various aspects of streaming (sound, picture, overlays and so on) is
WebcamStudio, which didn&rsquo;t exactly work. At the best of times it was giving me
something that looked like the stream I wanted to pass on, but I never managed
to actually get any streaming site to accept the data. This completely sidesteps
the issue that is the buggy-as-fuck interface, that neither looks good nor works
well.</p>

<p>The most stable solution I&rsquo;ve found, that has actually let me see my desktop on
the internet, is the combination of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Letting VLC capture your desktop with a wide array of flags to make sure it
comes out right. Figuring out those was a ton of fun.</li>
<li>Having a script called “jtvlc” catch the data and send it in through the
Justin.tv API.</li>
</ul>


<p>It&rsquo;s way better than nothing, but this gives me absolutely no ability to
customize the output, except choosing what part of my monitor set-up it should
grab.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In a way, I hope I&rsquo;ve missed something; I hope there&rsquo;s an obscure package that
simply grabs the part of the desktop you want, has a nice interface, and just
works. If that magic package exists however, then I haven&rsquo;t found it.</p>

<p>There are times when I really would have liked to share the view of one of my
screens, with some embedded microphone commentary. When the ideas pop up, I&rsquo;d
like to go ahead and just try them out, but in this case, I&rsquo;m completely
hindered. It might be that the process of getting these things to work under the
other systems is also a chore, but at least I&rsquo;ve seen plenty examples of there
being an end result. That&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve yet to see here in Linux.</p>
