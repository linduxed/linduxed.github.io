<div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I had an experience that was moving. It felt special, yet to the
casual observer it would have been anything but special.</p>

<p>It involved a <a href="http://www.puzl.co.uk/product_thumb.php?img=images/mini2_3_500.jpg&amp;w=400&amp;h=400">Rubik puzzle</a>
that I hadn’t solved yet, and I just felt like finishing it. After all, I know
how to solve a 2x2x2, so this one shouldn&rsquo;t have posed a problem.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Handle with care</h2>

<p>Inherent to the puzzle&rsquo;s design was that it turned strangely. In some cases the
turns were smooth, in other it felt like the contraption worked against you.
Regardless of it’s intricacies, I treated and used it like a regular 2x2x2; for
me it was as simple as them both being solved in more or less the same way.</p>

<p>So with the first of three “cubes” solved I started twisting and turning the
second one. As mentioned, it was normal that it occasionally stuck and made
a fuss about simple turns, but I kept on going, a couple of time forcing a turn
through instead of wiggling in the opposite direction.<br/>
After some work however, I had the second cube finished and only the last one
remained. Halfway through the third one however it happened.</p>

<p>Something broke.</p>

<p>Something inside the middle cube went loose, and the entire construction along
with it. This was with me being one and a half algorithm away from finishing the
puzzle for the first time.
I clasped the puzzle, realizing that if I let go of any one loose piece, the
entire thing would fall apart. Greedily, all I thought about was solving it,
despite its fragile state. Holding all the pieces on the first and the middle
cube together took a hand and some pressure, making the cube very hard to
maneuver, but this didn&rsquo;t sway me; there was no giving up. Slowly I approached
the last few moves, and I suddenly hit me that this thing was dying.</p>

<p>It was on respirator and intravenous, and I was still pushing it.</p>

<p>To make things worse, I got to be about four turns away from finishing the
entire puzzle when the thing stuck, there was no moving it. It was as if it had
given up; the last turn was made.
Seeing that there was no way to complete the puzzle, despite being so close,
I gave up. Putting it down on the table it went to pieces, its entire structure
crumbling part by part.</p>

<p>It was a strange moment because it felt like I had witnessed and been part of
a toy&rsquo;s death bed experience.</p>

<p>After looking at the pile of coloured plastic I stepped back and reminded myself
that it was just a toy. I left it at that.</p>
